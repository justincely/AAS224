Advanced Time-domain Calibrations and Data-reduction Techniques with HST/COS
============================================================================

This repository contains the poster and supporting material for the 224th meeting 
of the American Astronomical Society in Boston, along with hands-on tutorials 
demonstrating the methods described on the poster.

The posters are written in the iPython notebook, which will allow you to view, 
edit, and re-run each step.  

Untarring the data
==================
Before running the notebooks, make sure to untar the data with 
```make untar```

Starting the notebook
=====================
To run the iPython notebook, run in a terminal:
```ipython notbook```

This should launch a web-browswer with an interface to the workbooks.

Viewing
=======
The notebooks can be converted into a few more easily readible formats:

For HTML:
```make html```

For markdown:
```make markdown```
